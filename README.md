This is a very basic package with no validation whatsoever.

It will be maintaind and Updated if i see some difficulties.

It'll copy the settings from a `sftp-config.json` file in the current directory to a `./.vscode/sftpConfig.json` file to be compatible with VS Code's `SFTP` plugin. This is mostly to make migration easy if you have many `sftp-config.json` files in many projects.

Install with `-g` option. `npm install -g ThankorRS/sublime-to-vscode`.

In order to run, `cd` to the root folder (where the config file sleeps) of the project and run `sublime-to-vscode`.

The Plugin that is used to do the Magic is https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=suntobright.vscode-sftp.
Usage: Well that will be a Update for later. ;)
